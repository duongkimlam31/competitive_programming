Problem: Minimum Cost to Reach the Top
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-cost-to-reach-the-top-of-the-floor-by-climbing-stairs/

Given an array of integers cost[] of length n, where cost[i] is the cost of the ith step on a staircase. Once the cost is paid, we can either climb one or two steps.
We can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1. The task is to find the minimum cost to reach the top.

Examples: 

Input: cost[] = [10, 15, 20]
Output: 15
Explanation: The cheapest option is to start from step with index 1, pay cost[1] and go to the top.

Input: cost[] = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]
Output: 6 
Explanation: The cheapest option is to start from step with index 1on cost[0], and only step on 1s, skipping cost[3].
